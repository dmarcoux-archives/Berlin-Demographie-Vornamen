#Introduction

I am learning Sinatra with this project. I chose to build an API and I don't have a specific list of things I want to accomplish. I simply want to learn by doing.

#Data

I took the data on this website http://daten.berlin.de/kategorie/demographie, more specifically the CSV files under *Liste der h√§ufigen Vornamen 2014*. It lists the newborn names separated by sex and broken down by the neighborhoods.

#Usage
##Application

Run the application with `bundle exec rackup`.

##Specs

Run specs with `RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake test`. Setting the environment variable `RACK_ENV` isn't mandatory, but you should always set it if you don't want to alter your development database.

##Rubocop


##Guard


##Mutant
