Learning Sinatra by building an API with Berlin open data
```


#Introduction

I am learning Sinatra with this project. I chose to build an API and I don't have a specific list of things I want to accomplish. I simply want to learn by doing.


#Data

I took the data on this website http://daten.berlin.de/kategorie/demographie, more specifically the CSV files under *Liste der h√§ufigen Vornamen 2014*.
